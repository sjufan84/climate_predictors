# Climate change population migration infrastructure and investment analyses
The goal of this project is to use publicly available data from the US Census as well as climate change induced population migration models to identify investment opportunities and public infrastructure needs in communities that will see outsized growth due to the rapidly changing climate.  We will utilize multiple machine learning models to identify areas where capital and investments are most misallocated, initially focusing on real estate values and then possibly extending out into infrastructure needs such as housing units, hospitals, schools, etc.

### Tools used:
  We will primarily be utlizing Python, Sci-kit learn, Numpy, and various ML models to clean, analyze, and present our data and projections.

#### Basic web app deployed [here.](https://share.streamlit.io/sjufan84/climate_predictors/main)
